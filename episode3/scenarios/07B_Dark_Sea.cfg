They wondered that her story was — what circumstances could possibly have brought her to a remote place like that, away from any manner of civilization? And why would she, the free daughter of an untainted world, decide to take pity on a creature who existed only for the purpose of meting out punishment in the name of a goddess of death?

Unfortunately for them, she would never be able to answer those questions, for the gift that allowed her to give that one special person a second chance came with the complete inability to utter a sound. Not even her birth name was known to anyone in existence — “Mintha” was the first thing that came to the shapeshifter’s mind, and she seemed fond of it."

While she could not tell them her own story, she was happy to listen to the Nameless One tell her all about the vast unknown that lay far beyond Irdya. And she in turn showed them Irdya as it was, and as it is — a world of endless strife, yet also endless beauty."
